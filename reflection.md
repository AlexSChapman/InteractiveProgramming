#Reflection
Overall things went very well. The project was relatively well-scoped, and we were able to complete it in a orderly and educational fashion. That being said, our original goal was overly ambitious (a two-player asteroid-style space arcade game where one user was the pilot of a ship, and the other the gunner). While this project would have been much more intensive, and we would have learned more, it was just too much to do. 

Unit testing on this project was very difficult, as the majority of the issues came from server-client communication. In order to test the system it was necessary to boot the server, run the clients, check three terminals for errors, and usually cycle the whole system. Beyond this more effort could have been put into documenting the code as well as putting in a system of doctests. As it was, the doctests would have taken longer to implement than it took to test the methods by hand due to the inherited nature of the class architecture. In terms of teamwork we worked together well, though more partner worktime earlier on would have probably made integration more easily.
